## Introduction

One of the main concerns of students enrolled in all sorts of courses is whether they will find a job or not after finishing their studies.

In this report, I will analyze what factors influence the chances of finding good jobs after graduating from an MBA at an Indian university. Also, the results could be used by the institution to better select and guide their students during the course.

In the end, machine learning models will be created to try estimating if a student will find a job, and what wage it will receive.

### The Problem

Find what are the factors that lead to the best job opportunities for graduates from this institution.

### Questions

- What are the factors that lead to the person getting hired.
- What impacts the most on the salary.
- Can the institution predict if the person will get good results in the MBA before they are accepted?
  - The idea is that the institution would like to know beforehand if someone would fail to find a job after the MBA. The objective is to avoid accepting people that would not find a job and increase the employability rate of the institution.

### Benefits for the person:

The person will be able to know beforehand what to focus on to get the best results (placement/salary).

### Benefits for the institution:

The institution may be able to better select its students, reducing failures and placing its students in the best market positions. It might lead to higher renown for the institution.

Also, the institution may use the information to better prepare the course, focusing on the most important things to the market.
